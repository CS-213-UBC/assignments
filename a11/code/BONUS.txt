Using semaphores instead of mutexes solves the unfairness problem. 
For example for the problem with 20 people and 100 iterations, using mutexes resulted 
in one person waiting for 392 people to enter, while using semaphores for the same problem,
the maximum number people had to wait for is 19.

Despite using a queue with fifo order, using mutexes means that there is a chance a thread that
has not been waiting at all might be able to make its way into the critical section before the other
threads. 
Using semaphores prevents these scenarios from happening because it has an atomic counter. There is no 
delay between signalling and waiting and therefore it is always "fair", following fifo.
