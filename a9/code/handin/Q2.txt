The execution time for the same implementation using interrupts in an asynchronous method is significantly faster than in the polling method.

This is because in the first implementation (polling), the main thread has to wait for the disk read to return a result before requesting another diskread (PIO).
For the second implementation, the disk read requests (PIO) for all the num blocks are sent while the disk read is happening (in parallel). Disk can then interrupt once the data is available. Therefore it is significantly faster.
