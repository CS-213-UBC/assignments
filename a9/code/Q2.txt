The execution time for the same implementation using threads (Q2) is significantly 
faster than the implementation using asynchronous programming.

This is because in the first implementation, the main thread has to wait for the disk read to 
return a result before requesting another diskread (PIO).
For the second implementation, the disk read requests (PIO) for all the num blocks are sent all at once
while the disk read is happening (in parallel). Disk can process multiple requests in parallel.
therefore it is significantly faster.
