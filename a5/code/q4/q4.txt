There was 2 issues:
	1- when we were freeing element, we didn't free the element=>value as we have allocated for it
	2- When inserting to the tree, we didn't increment counter for both element and element->value
Solution:
	1- Edit element_free_ref & element_keep_ref to always free or keep for element-> value as we have allocated for it
	2- Use element_free_ref & element_keep_ref whenever we were doing a free or a keep for an element
	3- Use element_keep_ref when inserting element to the Tree
